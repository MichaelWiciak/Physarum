# Biocomputation

Create a .venv file in the root directory of the project.

Install required packages found in requirements.txt using pip.

Input into command line:

```bash
python physarum.py
```

This will run the script and generate the output files in the output directory.
A CV2 window will open displaying the simulation and at the end of the simulation, a GIF will be created in the output directory.
To modify the simulation parameters, edit the physarum.py file.
