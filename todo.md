5.  make food better.

food and boundaries left to do.

6. tell how much time it takes to do a step into a csv.
   so we can plot graphs. generate random files/run names etc. (utc???)

7. obstacles are important.

whats useful:

1. how long each step takes (but as divided by each big subsections (the move, difffuse etc)) (but make sure to save these parameters?)
2. save stats of a big simulation, how long each step takes and if its uniformly distributed?

1 file: per step, how much for each big section time and how much for a step overall and do that over time.
2 file:

1: normal distribution of time for each step for every agent? is that useful? to cehck how the times of it variate over time, but its the same thing so it shouldnt nad if it does, it hardware so useless?

and time over step count should be the same anyways.

performance analysis is hard since we dont know what he did exactly so hard to say how it was improved?
