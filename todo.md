1)Missing: The paper mentions a data layer for the environment configuration (e.g., obstacles, food). Your code does not currently include this. If you want to simulate pre-patterning cues or obstacles, youâ€™ll need to add a separate data layer or extend the current grid to include this information

2.  need to enforce Discrete Occupancy: The paper specifies that each grid cell can contain only one agent. Your code does not explicitly enforce this rule. While it might not be critical for small numbers of agents, you may want to add a check to ensure no two agents occupy the same cell.

3.  some things stay in the same spot and dont move.

5. its going dark wayyy to early.

Consider smoothing the direction choice (e.g., weighted average of sensors) to better match continuous gradient-following.
Example:

# In sense()

weights = [abs(val) for val in sensor_values] # Weight by signal strength
angle = sum(weights[i] _ (self.sensor_angle + (i - 1) _ np.pi / 4) for i in range(3)) / sum(weights)
self.direction = (np.cos(angle), np.sin(angle))

6. i dont think food has any effect on it at all... hmm.

7. simulation doesnt currently saisfy the Agents attempt to move forward one step in their current direction.
   If the next position is unoccupied, move and deposit a chemoattractant.
   If occupied, remain in place, reorient randomly, and do not deposit.
   No deposit occurs unless movement is successful.
   so need to change it.
